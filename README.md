# My-Python-Mini-Projects
A collection of all mini projects I made with Python. This is very suitable for beginners who know Python basics but don't know what to do next.
These projects mostly use ASCII art which made them much cooler. My code is not the best and you might want to change, refactor, shorten,... it.
